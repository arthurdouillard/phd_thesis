\section{Context}

\acf{AI} has been a subject of great interest for many decades, aiming at making machines reproduce more or less specific human behaviors, ranging from playing chess to producing medical diagnostics. Specifically, in the past decade, this domain has seen a rapid and almost exponential growth, being invested by numerous research labs and companies (like Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Amazon, etc.). Nowadays, applications of \ac{AI} are varied and show very impressive results. Those include information and image retrieval (web and image search engines), automatic translation, image recognition and classification (\eg Google Photos), face recognition, tracking of objects in videos, speech recognition, making autonomous vehicles drive, interpreting medical imagery, \etc.
